1. Do not forget to relate a user to employee ("related user field in the employee form" )

2. Do not forget to enter the project in the task form otherwise no mail will be sent to the customer.
However if already done then the work around is to manually send the mail to the customer using the default template.

3.Do not forget to enter the Customer Field in the project form otherwise again the mail will not be sent to the customer  
4.The timer will not start if the user is not related to an employee or if the he/she has not sighned in
5.Timer will not show any duration below 1 minute
6.The employee who has started the task, only that employee or the administrator can close the task
7.While signing out make sure all the tasks are closed
8.The timer should be started only once the user has been assigned to the task
9.Kanban view start and stop timer button
10. A mail is dispatched after the project is created to the customer only if the customer has been mentioned in the project form


Points to remember while installation of the module -

* delete the access right of project.task as this module creates it's own access rights so delete the old one

  settings --> groups --> project/user --> access rights

* delete the Administrator from the Project/User group so that the "Track task & progress" menuitem is not shown in administrator

* Installing sudo apt-get install python-easygui

* While installing (issue for portal user) ---> goto groups ---> type portal in the serach field ---> now in the portal modify the record rule for partner---> remove the tick from "read" and put the tick on create,delete,write 
* There will be a task rule created for the Employee........Just delete it ....because for the user i am saying only allow the message_follower_ids to view the task whereas the employee rule is allowing the user to see all the task  
* delete the portal rule for sales order
Timer functionality

There will be many2one field with each task that will be referenced to an object having three fields -->
1. Start Time
2. End Time
3. Difference

The kanban view button will all the time add the row to this many2one field and there will be a button that will add the difference of all the rows
Also do not let the user create a row if the user is not logged in 

For this goto hr_attendance folder --> hr_attendance.py --> find the method 'attendance_action_change'

He should only be allowed to start one task at a time
Also add on/off timer button in the right top corner of the form view of the task
If the user logouts then the task should be automatically stopped
Also the user should not be allowed to start the task with out signining in

Gantt View
--------------
Project form view ----> extra info tab ---> Gantt view according to start date and the end date fields
if due date(Deadline)  is passed then the gantt view should highlight red ....so the done button should be pressed before the deadline else it is highlighted red in the gantt view
starting date in the project.task gantt view is the problem.Orignially no problem but after installing dependency module something goes wrong with it

Issues Gantt View
------------------

Things to do
---------------
create a record rule for project.issue.time.recorder allowing the users to edit on this object
